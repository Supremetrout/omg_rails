Upgrades:
1. Squad Builder needs to delete squad upgrades for squads that are deleted in the UI. Cannot pass squad upgrades when the corresponding squad isn't also in the payload
2. Upgrades that increase squad pop or model count aren't updating the platoon's count. Similar for removing the upgrade


SquadBuilder
1. Fix company grid highlighting for transport squads when dragging
2. Fix double tooltips appearing when hovering over transported squad card
3. Only open the transport drop target when dragging units/squads
